\subsection{Single Sign-On and Federated Identity}

\ac{SSO} is a mechanism which allows users to sign into multiple independent software systems
using a single set of credentials.
It also requires the user to only perform a single action to authenticate against all participating services.
Such systems or services could be apps, websites or technical interfaces like \acp{API}.
After signing in, the user is not asked to enter their password again after visiting a different service.
Instead, the authentication information is stored and shared by all participating systems.
After signing in, the user can use the website or service
