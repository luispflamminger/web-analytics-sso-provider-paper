\subsection{Motivation}

One of the most difficult aspects of operating a website or app is dealing with user
authentication and passwords.

Regularly, hackers try to break into the databases of internet services to reveal account data and 
passwords of their users.

The best-practices for encrypting passwords and storing them safely are changing
continuously and keeping up with new security standards and requirements is costly and time consuming.

Managing passwords and usernames is not only a technical challenge, but also puts a burden
on end users.\footcite[Cp. ][p. 459]{Hoonakker2009}

A majority of users still don't manage their passwords in the recommended way, which is
generating a new password for each login and storing every password in a secure password safe.
A modern internet user on average uses x different services that require a login.
This results in most users using the same password for many or all of these services,
which makes it easy for hackers to overtake a users online presence if only one of their
passwords is hacked or leaked.

Because of these problems, SSO is good fivehead.







Digital services have revolutionized the way people 


Remembering passwords is hard bla bla

Reusing the same password is insecure and hackers have used this



- Account management is hard
- Hackers are trying to find security flaws and publish passwords
- Two factor authentication is annoying for customers etc.
