\section*{Abstract}

Internet users today have to remember passwords for many different websites.
Website owners on the other hand want to give users the option to create
an account and log in as seamlessly as possible, while also obtaining
the required user data.
A modern solution to this problem on the web is \ac{SSO}.
This paper gives an understanding of how the technology works by explaining
basic concepts and giving an overview of protocols and \ac{SSO} providers.
Furthermore, it discusses opportunities that \ac{SSO} offers
for online service providers and examines associated risks.
